# React Vite Project

This is a project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying src/App.jsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
